# Exploring Web Application Messaging Protocol
Repository to explore the power of [WAMP](https://wamp-proto.org/) using [autobahn](https://crossbar.io/autobahn/). 

While struggling to understand the need for WAMP's I stumbled upon [this](https://blog.eduonix.com/web-programming-tutorials/web-application-messaging-protocol/) resource which provided a good inuition for the need for the protocol.
[This](https://crossbario.com/blog/Free-Your-Code-Backends-in-the-Browser/) was quite informative too.

## Installation
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
